# tk4-MVS3.8j-Hercules
Yet another tk4-MVS3.8j-Hercules mainframe emulation support site. Not the best and not the worst either.

Inspired by Moshix (who dat? Look him up) here's more and more of the stuff I can't seem to remember without a cheat sheet. Ponder the pages and see if they help. Not like you're alone out here in the land of S/360 MVS emulation. Lots of sites, mostly ancient still abound. But this site should be the one you go to when you just don't know what to do.
